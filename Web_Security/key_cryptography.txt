# Privet Key Cryptography :-

- There is only 1 key ie Privet
- Privet key is used for both Encryption & Decreption
- Key is Symmetric
- If someone discovers the key then communication is compromised
- Both parties ie sender & receiver have equal control
- Receiver can modify the sender's message 


# Public Key Cryptography :-

- There is a Public key & Privet key
- Encryption & Decreption is not done by same key
- Here sender & receiver do not have equal control
- Both Keys are Asymmetric
- Allows secure communication without using Key Destribution Center (KDN)
- Varifies authenticity of user, makes sure message comes from sender

# How Public Key Works :-

- Sender have a privet key
- Which he uses to Decrept the message or sign the message
- Receiver have a Public Key
- Which he uses to Encryption the message or verifiy the signature
- Message can be Encrypted using both Public & Privet Key
- Public key can not Decrept the message
- Hence data of sender cannot be modify by receiver

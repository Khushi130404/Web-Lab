    - This form of data can be read by using another secret key called Decreption key.
    - There are 2 types of Encryption.
        1. Symmetric-Key = Where Encryption and Decreption key are same
        2. Asymmetric-Key = Where Encryption and Decreption key are different
    
    2. Access Control :-

    - This tool make sure who can access a system information.
    - This is done by having a set of rules and policies about who can access data.

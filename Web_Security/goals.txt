Goals of Web Security :- 

1. confidentiality of data
2. Integrity of data
3. Availability of data to authorized user



1. Confidentiality :-

- Confidentiality refers to the privacy of data
- It make sure that data cannot be read or write by the wring person

# Tools of Confidentiality :-
    
    1. Encryption : -

    - This tool makes the data unreadable using a secret key called Encryption key.
    - This key converts simple data into human unreadable form.
    - This form of data can be read by using another secret key called Decreption key.
    - There are 2 types of Encryption.
        1. Symmetric-Key = Where Encryption and Decreption key are same
        2. Asymmetric-Key = Where Encryption and Decreption key are different
    
    2. Access Control :-

    - This tool make sure who can access a system information.
    - This is done by having a set of rules and policies about who can access data.
    - This includes person's credentials to verifiy access.
    - Credentials can be username, e-mail, computer's series number.
    - Credentials that cannot be share provides most security. 


    3. Authentication :-

    - This tool verifies the user.
    - It is done by make user log into system with username and password.
    
    4. Authorization :- 

    - Authorization comes after authentication.
    - This tool decides whether to allow user to do certain task or not.
    - Authorization is given by access control policy.
    - This includes the acces of data, system, feature, application ect.

    5. Physical Security :-

    - This tool refers to physical security given to the place where data is stored.
    - Generally data is stored in servers and data centers.
    - Providing a CCTV camera, a security guard to prevent theft comes under this.
    - This also includes security form natural disasters like fire & earth quake.

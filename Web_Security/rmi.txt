# RMI :-

- Remote Method Invocation
- It is a mechanism in Java that allows one system to access object of another system
- It basically enables the communication between 2 different Java program 

# Architecture of RMI :-

1. Stub = It is a proxy object that represents remote object on client side
        = Client interects with Stub as it is remote object

2. Skeleton = It resides on server side
            = It communicates with stub to pass client's request to server

3. RRL = Remote Reference Layer
       = It manages reference of remote object
       = It passes the client's method call from Stub to Skeleton

4. Transport Layer = It setup and manages connection
                   = It allows communication between client & server

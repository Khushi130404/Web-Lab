            <p>
              COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus
              SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan,
              China, and has since spread globally, leading to a worldwide
              pandemic. The virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva
              or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or
              sneezes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rapid spread of the virus has overwhelmed healthcare systems
              around the world, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.
              Efforts to control the spread include social distancing measures,
              lockdowns, and the development of vaccines and treatments. The
              pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on global health, economies,
              and daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Governments and health organizations continue to work together to
              understand the virus, implement measures to control its spread,
              and mitigate its effects. Public health campaigns emphasize the
              importance of hygiene, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated to
              protect individuals and communities.

              Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and
              tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some
              patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache,
              conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, a
              rash on the skin, or discoloration of fingers or toes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe
              acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. People with
              underlying medical conditions and older adults are at a higher
              risk of developing serious complications from the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Symptoms typically appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.
              It is important to seek medical attention if you experience
              difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest,
              confusion, inability to stay awake, or bluish lips or face. Early
              diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and reduce the risk
              of severe illness.

              To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the
              following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them
                with an alcohol-based hand rub.
              </li>
              <li>Maintain at least a 1-meter distance from others.</li>
              <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
              <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
              <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
              <li>
                Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and
                staying away from large groups of people.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Wearing a mask in public settings, especially when social
              distancing is difficult to maintain, can help reduce the spread of
              the virus. Masks should be worn properly, covering both the nose
              and mouth, and should be used in conjunction with other preventive
              measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vaccination is a critical tool in controlling the pandemic.
              Vaccines have been developed and distributed globally, providing
              protection against severe illness and death caused by COVID-19.
              Staying informed about vaccination opportunities and getting
              vaccinated when eligible is essential for personal and public
              health.

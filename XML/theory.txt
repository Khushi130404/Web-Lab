XML = Extensible Markup Language
SGML = Standard Generalized Markup Language

XML v/s HTML
- In XML tags are not pre-defined as HTML
- XML focuses on data while HTML focuses on apprearance
- XML can be formated using XSLT
- XML can be validated using either DTD or Schema (XSD)
- XML allows multiple output forms while HTML have single representation

Why should not use Attributes ?
- There cant contain multiple value.
- They cant have tree like structure.
- The cant be expanded in future.
